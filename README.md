# Maker_Portfolio_Arduino_Code
Hello! Welcome to my maker portfolio repository. Here I have all the code I used in my sound-tracking robot, as well as the code for models leading up to this.

Each piece of code illustrates the steps that my project progressed through.

1. My project began with the sound_plotter code, where I first analyzed how my mic detected sound. This helped me formulate and troubleshoot my future code, as this basic function gave me unadulterated input to use.

2. Next, I made the sound_threshold_detector program, which had event detection software to indicate loud noises in the serial monitor. This code helped me design my other programs that had event detection as a basis.

3. The next piece of code, the buzzer_and_light_indicator program, uses a couple of LEDs and a buzzer to indicate sound levels. Based on sound intensity, certain LEDs will sound, and the loudest sounds trigger the buzzer. This is the model I went on to implement in my chassis for my final designs.

4. My next code, the motor_test, was used just to initialize and check my wiring on my chassis. This enabled me to successfully wire and use my robot for the latter code.

5. Next, I made my sound_stimulated_car code, which took my indicator programs and connected them to the chassis of my robot. This allowed the robot to drive when it detected louder sounds and increase speed depending on the intensity of the sound. Using this code, I was able to begin code for my final version: a robot that could track the direction of sound and move to it.
