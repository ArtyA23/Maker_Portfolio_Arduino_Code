# Maker_Portfolio_Arduino_Code
Hello! Welcome to my maker portfolio repository. Here I have all the code I used in my sound-tracking robot, as well as the code for models leading up to this.

Each piece of code illustrates the steps that my project progressed through.

1. My project began with the sound_plotter code, where I first analyzed how my mic detected sound. This helped me formulate and troubleshoot my future code, as this basic function gave me unadulterated input to use.

2. Next, I made the sound_threshold_detector...
